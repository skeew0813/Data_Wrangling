    "**Description**:  I created an SQLite database to integrate my three datasets containing NFL player statistics and NFL Hall of Fame data. After cleaning and standardizing column names, I loaded them into SQL tables and used joins on player and year to merge the data while handling duplicates with aggregation. Finally, I exported the joined dataset as a CSV for further analysis in Tableau, ensuring efficient querying and data integrity."
