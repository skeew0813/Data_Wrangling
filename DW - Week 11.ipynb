    "**Title**: Data Wrangling 11.2 Exercises  \n",
    "**Author**: Ryan Weeks  \n",
    "**Date**: 2/22/2025  \n",
    "**Description**:  These exercises focused on using SQLAlchemy to create and manage a database for storing and querying sensor and station data. I defined tables, inserted records, and queried them using SQLAlchemyâ€™s ORM capabilities. I also worked on creating relationships between the sensor and station tables, which helped me understand how data can be linked and queried efficiently. I used both SQL queries and pandas to analyze and retrieve data from the database. It was a great hands-on experience that gave me a deeper understanding of database management and querying while exploring the practical application of SQLAlchemy!"
